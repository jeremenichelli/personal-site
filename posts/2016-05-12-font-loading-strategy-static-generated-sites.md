title: Font loading strategy for static generated sites
excerpt: The lack of a progressive approach on font loading and styles can hide your content for a critical amount of time causing a negative experience for the user.

While we know a lot about [how to properly load web fonts][1] thanks to the reasearch and work of other developers, I've noticed some caveats when bringing these best practices to static generated sites.

## Observing web fonts

Assigning a font family that's not ready yet to a site makes the text invisible in some browsers and causes FOIT _(Flash of Invisible Text)_ in others. The best solution is to add a library which detects when the font is actually ready for use and provide a fallback family in the mean time.

First, set the styles to switch the font family only when a special class is present on top of our document.

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.fonts-loaded body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

Now, we need to add that class when the font's ready. In this example I'm going to use [Bram Stein's Font Face Observer][2] library, but there are some others that you might want to checkout.

```js
var robotoFamily = new FontFaceObserver('Roboto');

robotoFamily.load().then(function () {
  document.documentElement.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
});
```

With this simple set of lines we can move any project to a better font loading strategy.

_Remember you will still need to include a stylesheet that contains the font face rules in the page._

### Putting some dynamic on static

As any other resources, web fonts are cached for future use so it would be good to _leave a mark_ when we load the font for the first time so we can quickly enable it on consecutive page views.

When pages are generated dynamically this can be achieved by placing **cookies** and later detect their presence with sever side code like **php** and return a document with the class already added.

Of course this is not possible in static sites since the server already holds the final state of the document. An alternative is [sessionStorage][3].

```js
if (sessionStorage.getItem('fonts-loaded')) {
  // fonts cached, add class to document
  document.documentElement.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
} else {
  var robotoFamily = new FontFaceObserver('Roboto');

  robotoFamily.load().then(function () {
    document.documentElement.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
    // set mark on storage for future page views
    sessionStorage.setItem('fonts-loaded', true);
  });
}
```

The user will not see the text _switching_ from one font family to the desired one on every page load if the font files are already cached.

## The critical rendering path paradigm

To actually get rid of the _text switching issue_, the solution from above should be inlined in the head of the page.

The problem is that putting a big font event library in the head of the page will have a negative impact in loading times and that's a step backwards on our _content first_ strategy.

One way to solve this is to move the font observing logic to a different JavaScript file and conditionally loading it when the font is not cached using [loadJS function by Filament Group][4], which is really light weight.

The following code should be placed inside the head including the previously mentioned **loadJS** library.

```js
/* include loadJS library */

if (sessionStorage.getItem('fonts-loaded')) {
  // fonts cached, add class to document
  document.documentElement.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
} else {
  // load script with font observing logic
  loadJS('/scripts/font.js');
}
```

The **font.js** file will look similar to this.

```js
/* include Font Face Observer library */

var robotoFamily = new FontFaceObserver('Roboto');

robotoFamily.load().then(function () {
  document.documentElement.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
  // set mark on storage for future page views
  sessionStorage.setItem('fonts-loaded', true);
});
```

Users will only experiment a _flick_ in the font style on the first page view. You can check how this works on this [demo page][5] and the resulting code in its [repository][6].

## TL;DR

It's important to have a _strategy_ when using web fonts to prevent invisible text in some browsers.

For static generated sites this can be done loading a script which observes when the font is ready, toggling a class on the document and set a flag using _sessionStorage_ for future visits.
