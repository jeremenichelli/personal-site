He has worked in a wide spectrum of web projects. Mobile first sites, web applications and services and cool animated experiences, all written in JavaScript and Node.js, always with a keen eye on performance, user experience and best practices.

Lately he's been focusing on tooling and design systems.

## Experience

Early in his career he worked on responsive sites for clients like **Microsoft** and **StateFarm**, focusing in accessibility, cross browsing compatibility and design consistency.
