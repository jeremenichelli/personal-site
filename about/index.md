He worked in a wide spectrum of web projects, from mobile first sites to modern web applications, web services and animated experiences, all of them using JavaScript and Node.js, always with a keen eye on user experience, performance and best practices.

Lately he's been focusing in tooling and design systems.

## Experience

Early in his career he worked on responsive sites for clients like **Microsoft** and **StateFarm**, focusing in accessibility, cross browsing compatibility and pixel perfect design.

In **OrderGroove** he helped build and maintain their core JavaScript applications.
