His interest in web development started back when he opened a website for the first time as a kid and asked himself why it was so slow.

He worked in a wide spectrum of projects, from mobile first sites to modern web applications, web services and animated experiences.

All of them using JavaScript and Node.js, always with a keen eye on user experience, performance and best practices.

Lately, he's been focusing in tooling and design systems.

## Experience

Early in his career he developed on responsive sites for clients like **Microsoft** and **StateFarm**, focusing in accessibility and cross browsing compatibility, working closely with designers on processes and patterns.

In **OrderGroove** he helped build and maintain their core JavaScript applications.

He later joined as a technical lead at **Jam3** creating animated web experiences for clients including **Facebook**, **Pixar**, **Doritos**, **Oreo** and many more.

After that, he joined **Typeform** as a front end engineer and led the design system project of the company, and initiatives around it.
